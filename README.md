# 🚀 Vyntrix — No-Code Platform for Solana Smart Contracts

![Vyntrix Banner](https://vyntrix.vercel.app/VyntrixBanner.png)

Vyntrix is a **no-code development platform** for Solana that enables developers, founders, and creators to **build, deploy, and manage smart contracts** without writing a single line of Rust.

Whether you're building a dApp, launching a token, or just experimenting on-chain — Vyntrix makes the process blazing fast, accessible, and beautifully simple.

## 🔍 Why We Built Vyntrix

After spending over a year building on Solana, we realized the entry barrier was still high. Learning Rust, understanding Anchor, and managing deployment tools was time-consuming — especially when all you wanted was a simple contract to manage users, tokens, or NFTs.

Inspired by how **Supabase** transformed full-stack development, we wanted to bring the same ease and power to Solana smart contracts. A **Supabase-like experience** but for **on-chain development**.

> **The goal?** A single platform where you can:
- Design smart contracts like you create tables.
- Auto-generate clean, deployable Anchor-compatible code.
- Expand to managing users, tokens, NFTs, storage, and more.
- Deploy to devnet/mainnet with a click.
- Skip the complexity — ship faster.

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ **Create "Tables"** — represent Solana accounts visually  
- 🧩 **Add Fields** — PubKey, String, Bool, Int, and more  
- 🔐 **Access Controls** — Editable / Deletable toggles  
- 🛠 **One-click Rust Code Generation** — Based on Anchor  
- ✨ **Beautiful UI** — Clean, developer-focused interface  
- 🔁 **Re-generate anytime** — Modify & regenerate with no fuss

- ✅ Design contract "tables"
- ✅ Add fields (PubKey, string, bool, etc.)
- ✅ Set access (editable/deletable)
- ✅ One-click Rust code generation
- 🔁 Perfect for your next Colosseum hackathon project.

## 🧠 How It Works

Vyntrix has three major components:

### 1. **Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)**
- Interactive UI to create tables and fields
- Real-time updates with Supabase

### 2. **CodeGen Engine (TypeScript)**
- Parses table schema
- Generates Rust + Anchor-compatible smart contract code
- Formats and structures code with clean design patterns

### 3. **Solana Integration**
- Generates dev-ready smart contracts
- Easily copy-paste into [SolPG](https://beta.solpg.io/) or any Solana IDE
- Future integration with `solana-cli`, Blinks, Token metadata, NFTs, and deployments
